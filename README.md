# This is your WordPress Root starter kit

This repo should be the base for any new WordPress projects.

To get started, fork this repo, clone it and then run `$ composer install`

All dependencies are managed by composer. WordPress itself is installed as a dependency in the wp/ catalogue.

## Vagrant (VVV)

If you're running VVV, change the URL values in vvv-hosts and vvv-nginx.conf then run `$ vagrant provision` to get started.
